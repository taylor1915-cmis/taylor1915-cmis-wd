		</h2>
		<ol>
				<li>Open Terminal</li>
				<li>Make sure your in your repository folder (cd username), and enter in the command "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" This will start the development server.</li>
				<li>Create your html folder by typing "gedit 'filename.html'</li>
				<li>Now to google and type in "localhost:8000/filename.html" You won't be able to see any changes unless you have done some editing and saving to the html folder.</li> 
 	<li>Start editing your folder, and remember the html format. Copy and paste the template into your file, and add in or change your information. Remember that everytime you make a change to your html folder, you must save it or else nothing will change. </li> 
				<li>Everytime you make a change and you save, refresh your page, and your changes should appear.</li>
				<li>To style your html page, you need to open up a css file. To do this you must put in the command: "gedit 'filenameofhtml.css'</li>	
				<li>Go back to your html folder and under 'meta charset' put in the link 'link rel="stylesheet" href="filename.css" type="text/css"</li>
				<li>Now you can start editing your html on the css folder. Remember to style a certain part of your html you must put in the name of the section and the bracket "{" and to close it put in the bracket "}" after every styling, remember that you must put a semicolon at the end, otherwise the styles after will not appear. </li>  	
				<li>Once you like what you have done you must save both your html and css to your repository folder with the commands "git add, git commit, and git push"</li>
				<li>To view it on the production server you put in the command: "sftp username@cmis-hsteacher" It will then ask you for your password.</li>	
				<li>It will ask you if you want to connect, click the yes, and it will then say you have been connected to the production server.</li>
				<li>Make sure your in the public folder so put in the command: "cd" and click public.html. This will make put you into the public folder.</li>
