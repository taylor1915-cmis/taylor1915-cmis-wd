			What I learned in this assignment
		</h3>
		<p>
			In this assignment, I learned how to create an ordered and an unordered lists. I also learned how to specifically style things within the same element, and how to style two things at the same time.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Create a file called "listsandlinks.html" in your repository folder. </li>
			<li>In "listsandlinks.html" create an detailed ordered list of step by step instructions to create a new webpage view it on the production server.</li>
			<li>Also create an unordered list of 5 or more links to websites with useful webdesign related information.</li>
		<li>In the nav section, create an unordered list of links with a link back to your main index.html page. </li>
			<li>In the nav element of your main index.html file in public_html, add an unordered list of links with a link to "listsandlinks".</li>
		<li>In your old index.html, add a heading and a paragraph description of this assignment. Also add an unordered list that contains this list of requirements. </li>
		<li>Add declarations to your main.css file to style the lists and links that you created. </li>
		<li>Style the box model properties for all elements.
			border
			margin
			padding
			width
			height</li>
		<li>Use these 2 new selector types.
comma separated - (h1, h2) applies same properties to h1 AND h2
no-comma separated - (main p) applies to all p elements inside the main element </li>
		<li>Turn in your work. </li>
		</ul>
